# Maze-Solver
Project in Python

This project Solves mazes that Have the 'S' symbol as start and 'E' Symbol as the end. The mazes solver will only read files with those two characters and '#'
This program can handle errors and will not allow Bad data or files to be entered. The Maze Solver checks first if the file is fitting the constraints and then checks if 'S' exists within the maze. The Maze solver then traverses through all the spaces and back tracks everything until finding the end or reaching the start and stating no 'E' is present in the maze.
